        """

            Returns the request data as a key/value table.
            A high-level convenience function.
            The body is parsed with the most appropriate format:
            * If `mimetype` is specified, it decodes the body with the requested
              content type (if supported). This takes precedence over any content type
              present in the request.
              The optional argument `mimetype` can be one of the following strings:
                * `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
                * `application/json`
                * `multipart/form-data`
            Whether `mimetype` is specified or a request content type is otherwise
            present in the request, each content type behaves as follows:
            * If the request content type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`:
              * Returns the body as form-encoded.
            * If the request content type is `multipart/form-data`:
              * Decodes the body as multipart form data
                (same as `multipart(kong.request.get_raw_body(),
                kong.request.get_header("Content-Type")):get_all()` ).
            * If the request content type is `application/json`:
              * Decodes the body as JSON
                (same as `json.decode(kong.request.get_raw_body())`).
              * JSON types are converted to matching Lua types.
            * If the request contains none of the above and the `mimetype` argument is
              not set, returns `nil` and an error message indicating the
              body could not be parsed.
            The optional argument `max_args` can be used to set a limit on the number
            of form arguments parsed for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` payloads.
            The third return value is string containing the mimetype used to parsed
            the body (as per the `mimetype` argument), allowing the caller to identify
            what MIME type the body was parsed as.

        Phases:
            rewrite, access, response, admin_api

        Example:
            body, err, mimetype = kong.request.get_body()

            body.name # "John Doe"

            If the body has no size (empty), this function returns an empty string.
            If the size of the body is greater than the Nginx buffer size (set by
            `client_body_buffer_size`), this function fails and returns an error
            message explaining this limitation.

        Phases:
            rewrite, access, response, admin_api

        Example:
            # Given a body with payload "Hello, Earth!":

            kong.request.get_raw_body():gsub("Earth", "Mars") # "Hello, Mars!"

        :return: The plain request body.

    def get_raw_path() -> str:
        """

            Returns the path component of the request's URL. It is not normalized in
            any way and does not include the query string.
            **NOTE:** Using the raw path to perform string comparision during request
            handling (such as in routing, ACL/authorization checks, setting rate-limit
            keys, etc) is widely regarded as insecure, as it can leave plugin code
            vulnerable to path traversal attacks. Prefer `kong.request.get_path()` for
            such use cases.

        Phases:

            include the leading `?` character.

        Phases:
